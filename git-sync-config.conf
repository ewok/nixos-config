# Git Sync Configuration File
# Format: LOCAL_PATH|BRANCH_NAME|REMOTE_NAME|REMOTE_URL
# 
# - LOCAL_PATH: Path to the local git repository
#               Supports: absolute paths, ~ (home), $HOME and ${HOME} variables
#               Examples: ~/projects/repo
#                        $HOME/projects/repo
#                        /absolute/path/to/repo
# - BRANCH_NAME: Branch to sync (must be currently checked out)
# - REMOTE_NAME: Name of the remote to sync with (e.g., "origin", "vps", "upstream")
# - REMOTE_URL: SSH URL of the remote repository
#
# IMPORTANT: The script only syncs when the current branch matches BRANCH_NAME
# If you're on a different branch, the script will show a warning and skip.
# If the repository is in detached HEAD state, it will also be skipped.
#
# Examples:
# ~/projects/repo|main|origin|ssh://git@git.vps.ewok.email:222/user/repo.git
# $HOME/projects/repo|develop|upstream|ssh://git@git.vps.ewok.email:222/user/another.git
# /absolute/path/to/repo|main|origin|ssh://git@git.vps.ewok.email:222/user/repo.git
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored

# Repositories to sync
~/projects/nixos-config|vps|vps|ssh://git@git.vps.ewok.email:222/ewok/os-config.git
